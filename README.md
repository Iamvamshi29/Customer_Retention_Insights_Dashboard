📊 Telco Customer Churn Analysis & Retention Insights

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn patterns for a telecom company using Power BI and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python.
The goal is to identify key factors influencing churn and provide actionable insights to improve customer retention.

🚀 Project Overview

Dataset: Telco Customer Churn (7,043 records, 22 columns).

Churn Rate: ~27% (0.27).

Tech Stack:

🐍 Python (EDA, preprocessing)

📊 Power BI (dashboards, visualizations)

📝 Microsoft Excel/SQL (data handling)

🔍 Key Insights
1. Customer Demographics

Gender distribution is balanced (≈50% Male, 50% Female).

Dependents: Majority (≈70%) have no dependents.

Partners: Split is nearly equal (No: 3.6K, Yes: 3.4K).

2. Churn Analysis

Churn Rate: 27% (1 in 4 customers leave).

Contract Type:

Month-to-Month customers have the highest churn.

Two-Year contracts show lowest churn.

Payment Methods:

Customers paying via electronic check churn more compared to auto-payment methods.

3. Tenure Analysis

Median Tenure: 29 months.

Average Tenure: 32.4 months.

Churned customers generally have much lower tenure than retained customers.

4. Risk Indicators (EDA)

High Monthly Charges → Higher churn probability.

Senior Citizens → More likely to churn.

Longer Tenure & Higher Total Charges → Lower churn risk.

📈 Dashboards

Interactive Power BI dashboards provide:

Customer breakdown by gender, partner, and dependent status.

Tenure distribution (box plot, histogram).

Churn comparison by tenure, contract type, and payment method.

Key retention KPIs.

🛠 Next Steps

Feature engineering (e.g., tenure buckets, bundled services).

Build predictive churn models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Implement explainability (e.g., SHAP values) for decision support.

Recommend retention strategies for high-risk segments.
